      Instructions
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.</li>
      <li>Mash bananas with a fork.</li>
      <li>Slice the butter into smaller chunks & then soften the butter in a microwave.</li>
      <li>Stir bananas, butter, eggs & sugar together in a large mixing bowl. Mix until fully blended.</li>
      <li>Mix in the remaining ingredients. Stir until the batter is fully mixed.</li>
      <li>Optional - If you want to enhance this “basic” easy banana bread, you can stir in 1 cup of your family’s favorite dessert ingredient (e.g. chocolate chips or chopped walnuts) after you have mixed the batter.</li>
      <li>Pour the finished batter into a nonstick bread pan. Smooth out the top of the batter within the bread pan.</li>
      <li>Bake in the oven for 65 to 70 minutes at 325 degrees F.</li>
      <li>Take out of oven and let the banana bread cool down in the bread pan for 10 minutes. Use oven mitts. Do not remove the banana bread from the bread pan during this 10 minute cool down period.</li>
      <li>After 10 minutes, remove the banana bread from the bread pan. Place the banana bread on a cooling rack in order to completely cool. This cool down may take 1 to 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
